# Game Programming Animation Lesson
This project was an introductory lesson on animation. Learning about animation controllers and animation clips was very eye opening on how video games use them.

To run the game, open the build folder and run the Animation.exe file. However, to exit the build of the game, you will have to close the program manually which you can do from either the taskbar or task manager.

To view the project in the Unity editor, open the Animation folder using UnityHub to open it as a project.
